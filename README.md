## SEEDRA PROTOCOL

**Secure Ethical Encrypted Data & Rights Architecture** – A modular identity and access control protocol for symbolic AI, built to protect user memory, enable adaptive interfaces, and ensure ethical AI deployment.

## 🔐 WHAT IS SEEDRA?

SEEDRA is a deterministic seed-based encryption and access system. It generates symbolic passphrases (words, emojis, numbers) to grant personalized, secure access to:

- 🧠 Memory logs (via OXN Memoria)
- 🔐 Cognitive Permission Tiers (CPT)
- 🌐 Encrypted AGI communications
- 🎭 Biometric pairing (future: face, voice)

## 🌱 FEATURES

- 3-Tier Access Structure (CPT)
- 6 to 24 symbolic seeds (words, emojis, etc.)
- Seed Validator & Verifier Modules
- Optional 2FA Integration
- Identity Trace Lock-in (non-deletable logs)
- Dynamic adaptability across devices & environments

## 📁 FOLDER STRUCTURE

- `core/`: Seed validation and encryption logic  
- `identity/`: Protocol + Verifier modules  
- `seedra_docs/`: Diagrams, slides, papers  
- `tests/`: Validation scenarios (TBD)

## ⚙️ USAGE

Run the verifier script:
```bash
python3 seedra/identity/seedra_verifier.py
